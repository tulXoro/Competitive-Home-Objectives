# CutieHackathon2020 - Competitive Home Objectives

## Description

This was the first hackathon project that I participated in. The theme of the hack was "Stay At Home". We decided to build a website using a free domain that we received. The main idea behind this project was to compete against other people in your household. Randomly, 7 objectives will be displayed. They can range from chores to things you could do at home. A new objective will replace completed ones. The person who completes the most objectives by the end of their chosen amount of time wins. You may view the project and hackathon details [here](https://devpost.com/software/competitive-home-objectives).
