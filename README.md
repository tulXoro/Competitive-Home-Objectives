## Cutie Hackathon 2020 Submission
This was our first hackathon and the theme of the hack was "Stay At Home". We decided to build a website using a free domain that we received.

### Idea
The main idea behind this project was to compete against other people in your household. Randomly, 7 objectives will be displayed. They can range from chores to things you could do at home. A new objective will replace completed ones. The person who completes the most objectives by the end of their chosen amount of time wins.

### Rules
1) Prepare a timer and set the amount of time the game will take place.
2) Enter a unique name for each player.
3) Click "start" and start the timer.
4) Complete the task physically before you mark the task as complete on the website.
5) Complete as many objectives as possible to win.
